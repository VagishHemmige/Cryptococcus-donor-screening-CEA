When transmission occurs through the donor, it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.\nBecause donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, most transplant programs do not routinely screen donors for cryptococcus. Instead, current practice typically relies on: - clinical donor history, - cause of death, - gross or histopathologic findings, - and post-transplant vigilance.\nHowever, advances in antigen testing and increasing attention to donor-derived infections have renewed debate about whether systematic donor screening could prevent severe outcomes at an acceptable cost."

    "text": "Why screening is controversial\nRoutine cryptococcal screening of donors raises several competing concerns:\n\nLow incidence: Donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, so most screened donors would test negative.\nFalse positives: Even highly specific tests can generate false positives when prevalence is very low, potentially leading to unnecessary organ discard or recipient prophylaxis.\nDownstream consequences: A positive donor test may trigger recipient antifungal treatment, delayed transplant, or organ non-use, each with its own harms and costs.\nSevere consequences when missed: When donor-derived infection does occur, outcomes can be devastating.\n\nBecause these tradeoffs involve rare events with high impact, intuition alone is often insufficient to guide policy."

In practical terms, the analysis asks:\n\nIf we adopt a particular donor screening or management strategy, what are the expected clinical outcomes and costs across many transplants?\n\nRather than focusing on individual cases, the model estimates average outcomes across a large hypothetical cohort of transplants, incorporating uncertainty in infection risk, test performance, treatment effectiveness, and costs."
