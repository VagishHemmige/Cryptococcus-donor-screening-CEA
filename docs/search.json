When transmission occurs through the donor, it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.\nBecause donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, organ procurement organizations do not routinely screen donors for cryptococcus. Instead, current practice typically relies on:\n\nclinical donor history,\ncause of death,\ngross or histopathologic findings, and\npost-transplant vigilance.\n\nHowever, advances in antigen testing and increasing attention to donor-derived infections have renewed debate about whether systematic donor screening could prevent severe outcomes at an acceptable cost."

    "text": "Why screening is controversial\nRoutine cryptococcal screening of donors raises several competing concerns:\n\nLow incidence: Donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, so most screened donors would test negative.\nFalse positives: Even highly specific tests can generate false positives when prevalence is very low, potentially leading to unnecessary organ discard or recipient prophylaxis.\nDownstream consequences: A positive donor test may trigger recipient antifungal treatment, delayed transplant, or organ non-use, each with its own harms and costs.\nSevere consequences when missed: When donor-derived infection does occur, outcomes can be devastating.\n\nBecause these tradeoffs involve rare events with high impact, intuition alone is often insufficient to guide policy."

The effect of this variation on the outcome of interest—such as costs or QALYs, is then calculated.\nEach horizontal bar in a tornado diagram represents a single model parameter. The length of the bar shows how much the outcome changes when that parameter is varied across its specified range.\n\nLonger bars indicate parameters that have a greater influence on the model results\n\nShorter bars indicate parameters with relatively little impact\n\nParameters are ordered from top to bottom by their impact, creating the characteristic “tornado” shape\n\nThe center line represents the base-case estimate.

    "text": "A tornado diagram is a graphical summary of a one-way sensitivity analysis, which examines how sensitive the results of a cost-effectiveness model are to changes in individual input parameters.\nIn a one-way sensitivity analysis, one parameter is varied at a time across a plausible range (for example, its 95% confidence interval), while all other parameters are held constant at their base-case values. The effect of this variation on the outcome of interest—such as costs or QALYs, is then calculated.\nEach horizontal bar in a tornado diagram represents a single model parameter. The length of the bar shows how much the outcome changes when that parameter is varied across its specified range.\n\nLonger bars indicate parameters that have a greater influence on the model results\n\nShorter bars indicate parameters with relatively little impact\n\nParameters are ordered from top to bottom by their impact, creating the characteristic “tornado” shape\n\nThe center line represents the base-case estimate. The left and right ends of each bar correspond to the low and high values of the parameter, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code\n\n\n\nThe one-way sensitivity analysis shown on this page is implemented in:\n\nR/create_sensitivity_analysis_QC.R\n\nThis script defines parameter distributions and computes expected costs and QALYs while varying one parameter at a time."

In this case, its low value suggests that further information would not meaningfully change the estimated NMB from screening."
