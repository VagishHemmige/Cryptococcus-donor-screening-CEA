    "text": "Clinical background\nCryptococcosis in kidney transplant recipients is uncommon but potentially catastrophic. When transmission occurs through the donor, it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.\nBecause donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, organ procurement organizations do not routinely screen donors for cryptococcus. Instead, current practice typically relies on:\n\nclinical donor history,\ncause of death,\ngross or histopathologic findings, and\npost-transplant vigilance.\n\nHowever, advances in antigen testing and increasing attention to donor-derived infections have renewed debate about whether systematic donor screening could prevent severe outcomes at an acceptable cost."

    "text": "Why screening is controversial\nRoutine cryptococcal screening of donors raises several competing concerns:\n\nLow incidence: Donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, so most screened donors would test negative.\nFalse positives: Even highly specific tests can generate false positives when prevalence is very low, potentially leading to unnecessary organ discard or recipient prophylaxis.\nDownstream consequences: A positive donor test may trigger recipient antifungal treatment, delayed transplant, or organ non-use, each with its own harms and costs.\nSevere consequences when missed: When donor-derived infection does occur, outcomes can be devastating.\n\nBecause these tradeoffs involve rare events with high impact, intuition alone is often insufficient to guide policy."

In practical terms, the analysis asks:\n\nIf we adopt a particular donor screening or management strategy, what are the expected clinical outcomes and costs across many transplants?\n\nRather than focusing on individual cases, the model estimates average outcomes across a large hypothetical cohort of transplants, incorporating uncertainty in infection risk, test performance, treatment effectiveness, and costs."
