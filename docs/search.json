When transmission occurs through the donor, it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.\nBecause donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, organ procurement organizations do not routinely screen donors for cryptococcus. Instead, current practice typically relies on:\n\nclinical donor history,\ncause of death,\ngross or histopathologic findings, and\npost-transplant vigilance.\n\nHowever, advances in antigen testing and increasing attention to donor-derived infections have renewed debate about whether systematic donor screening could prevent severe outcomes at an acceptable cost."

    "text": "Why screening is controversial\nRoutine cryptococcal screening of donors raises several competing concerns:\n\nLow incidence: Donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, so most screened donors would test negative.\nFalse positives: Even highly specific tests can generate false positives when prevalence is very low, potentially leading to unnecessary organ discard or recipient prophylaxis.\nDownstream consequences: A positive donor test may trigger recipient antifungal treatment, delayed transplant, or organ non-use, each with its own harms and costs.\nSevere consequences when missed: When donor-derived infection does occur, outcomes can be devastating.\n\nBecause these tradeoffs involve rare events with high impact, intuition alone is often insufficient to guide policy."
