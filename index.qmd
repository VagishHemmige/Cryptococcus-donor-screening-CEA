## Clinical background

[Cryptococcosis in kidney transplant recipients](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/12/5/ofaf263/8121609) is uncommon but potentially catastrophic. When [transmission occurs through the donor](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8096655/), it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.

Because donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, organ procurement organizations **do not routinely screen donors for cryptococcus**. Instead, current practice typically relies on:

-   clinical donor history,
-   cause of death,
-   gross or histopathologic findings, and
-   post-transplant vigilance.

However, [advances in antigen testing](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0011140) and [increasing attention to donor-derived infections](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ctr.13547) have renewed debate about whether **systematic donor screening** could prevent severe outcomes at an acceptable cost.


## Why screening is controversial

Routine cryptococcal screening of donors raises several competing concerns:

-   **Low incidence**: Donor-derived cryptococcosis is rare, so most screened donors would test negative.
-   **False positives**: Even highly specific tests can generate false positives when prevalence is very low, potentially leading to unnecessary organ discard or recipient prophylaxis.
-   **Downstream consequences**: A positive donor test may trigger recipient antifungal treatment, delayed transplant, or organ non-use, each with its own harms and costs.
-   **Severe consequences when missed**: When donor-derived infection does occur, outcomes can be devastating.

Because these tradeoffs involve **rare events with high impact**, intuition alone is often insufficient to guide policy.


## What this analysis does

This project uses [**decision-analytic modeling**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3746772/) to evaluate different strategies for managing cryptococcus risk in organ donors. In practical terms, the analysis asks:

> *If we adopt a particular donor screening or management strategy, what are the expected clinical outcomes and costs across many transplants?*

Rather than focusing on individual cases, the model estimates **average outcomes across a large hypothetical cohort of transplants**, incorporating uncertainty in infection risk, test performance, treatment effectiveness, and costs.


## Strategies evaluated

The analysis compares:

-   no routine screening *vs.*
-   donor screening with cryptococcal antigen testing, combined with recipient prophylaxis,


## What “cost-effectiveness” means here

Cost-effectiveness analysis estimates:

-   how much additional **cost** is associated with a strategy, and
-   how much additional health benefit it produces in [**quality-adjusted life years**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-technology-assessment-in-health-care/article/abs/use-of-qualityadjusted-life-years-for-the-estimation-of-effectiveness-of-health-care-a-systematic-literature-review/BC49C883502D9FD601136FB90316C219).

This analysis is based on a prior abstract [presented at American Transplant Congress](https://atcmeetingabstracts.com/abstract/preventing-donor-derived-cryptococcal-infections-should-we-screen-potential-organ-donors-with-a-serum-cryptococcal-antigen-a-cost-analysis/) in 2019.
