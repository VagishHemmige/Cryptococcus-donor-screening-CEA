## Alternative case #1

Does the near-elimination of organ wastage (`p_cancelled`=0.01) affect the results of the base case?

We see that this improves the NMB associated with screening but does not make screening the preferred strategy.


## Alternative case #2

Does the near-elimination of organ wastage (`p_cancelled`=0.01) **and** near-universal prophylaxis (`p_prophrate`=0.99) affect the results of the base case?

While screening is no longer cost-saving in this scenario due to increased fluconazole costs, NMB is now expected to be positive, suggesting some benefit of screening.

## Alternative case #3

If the cost of cryptococcus is dramatically higher (`cost_disease`=3000000), does this affect our conclusions?

In this setting, the effects of organ wastage still appear to win out over the costs of disease.


## Alternative case #4

IF we set the cost of cryptococcal disease markedly higher (`cost_disease`=3000000) while also assuming the near-elimination of organ wastage (`p_cancelled`=0.01) **and** near-universal prophylaxis (`p_prophrate`=0.99), what do we conclude?

Screening is clearly the preferred strategy under these circumstances.
